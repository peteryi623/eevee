COMPILING AND RUNNING C FILES
After writing the program, compile it by writing in terminal
gcc hello.c -o hello
gcc is the command that actually compiles it.
-o hello just names the actual compiled file.
Then run the compiled file by writing
./hello
./hello just runs the compiled file that is named hello


VIM
Move around:  Use the cursor keys, or "h" to go left, "j" to go down, "k" to go up, "l" to go right.
When i is pressed, VIM is on insert mode, and you can edit your file.
When in insert mode, press esc and write : to go into command mode.
Control z - gets out of VIM
	VIM Commands
	Close this window:  Use ":q<Enter>".
	   Get out of Vim:  Use ":qa!<Enter>" (careful, all changes are lost!).
	Jump to a subject:  Position the cursor on a tag (e.g. |bars|) and hit CTRL-].
